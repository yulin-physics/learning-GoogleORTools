## Metaheuristic Options

Change strategy for a large data set where first solution strategy doesn't yield a good solution.

In [TSP](travelling_sales_man.py) (10 nodes), the added advance search makes no difference to the result and first solution strategy is sufficient. In [Circuit Board](circuit_board.py) (280 nodes), the advance search returns a different solution as you tune the limit and is usually better than the deterministic first solution.

The local search metaheuristic let solver escape a local minimumâ€”a solution that is shorter than all nearby routes, but which is not the global minimum.

Local search requires a set limit on run time or number of solution trials.

```
search_parameters = pywrapcp.DefaultRoutingSearchParameters()
search_parameters.local_search_metaheuristic = (
routing_enums_pb2.LocalSearchMetaheuristic.GUIDED_LOCAL_SEARCH)
search_parameters.time_limit.seconds = 30
search_parameters.solution_limit = 1000
search_parameters.log_search = True
```
